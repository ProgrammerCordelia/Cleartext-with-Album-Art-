Cleartext by Redsaph but with Album Art and Album Info! 
Working with the following players:  AIMP,  Foobar2000, iTunes, Spotify, JRiver Media Center, Windows Media Player and also web player's on the browser such as YouTube, SoundCloud, BandCamp, Twitch, VK etc.
I got sick of the Spotify API breaking all the time and not supporting Album Info so I shifted to getting my current track info from last.fm which is a lot smoother and has been stable for years, plus a lot players can scrobble (send current track info) to last.fm and be controlled by Rainmeter at the same time, making it convenient to shift. So this skin gets all the info from last.fm but can control various players meanwhile those players share the current track info to last.fm and yeah, you get the idea.

How to make it work:
    1. Make an account at Last.fm
    2. Note down your username.
    3. Enter your last.fm username where "Enter Username" is written .
    4. Make sure the Music Player you're using is scrobbling, i.e., sending info about the track you're playing to last.fm.

List of supported players and how to make them work with last.fm and thus with this skin is given below:-
 
MAKING IT WORK WITH SPOTIFY:
Go to Last.fm and log in.
Hover over your profile image in the top-right. 
Click Settings.
Click Applications.
Click Connect, next to Spotify Scrobbling.
Continue to allow access to your Spotify account. 
Done! Enter your username in the skin and your current track info + album info should load as you play on Spotify.
Right-Click the skin, Click on "Choose Player", and select Spotify so you can use the controls.

MAKING IT WORK WITH AIMP:

     1. Go to Menu > Preferences > Plugins > Last.fm and authorize your account when prompted for it by clicking on "Allow."
     2. You'll be redirected to the last.fm site where you should click "YES, ALLOW" when asked if AIMP should be given permission to your account.
     3. Done! Enter your username in the skin and your current track info should load.
     4. Right-Click the skin, click on "Choose Player", and select AIMP so you can use the controls.

MAKING IT WORK WITH Foobar2000:

    1. Download Foobar2000 plugin as .zip from: poiru.github.io/foo-cad/
    2. Open Foobar2000, go to Files > Preferences > Components > Install and select the .zip folder you just downloaded.
    3. Click Apply and restart Foobar2000 for the changes to take effect. 
    4. Right-Click the skin, click on "Choose Player", and select Foobar2000 and now you can use the controls for FooBar2000.
    5. Open Foobar2000, go to Files > Preferences > Components > Tools > Audioscrobbler.
    6. Enter your last.fm username and password
    7. Restart and now the album art + current track info should load on the skin as it gets scrobbled to last.fm :)

MAKING IT WORK WITH iTunes:

    1. Install Last.fm Desktop Scrobbler from: Last.fm Desktop Scrobbler
    2. Enter your username and password on the app to authorize it.
    3. Make sure to tick "iTunes" as a plugin when prompted.
    4. Right-Click the skin, click on "Choose Player", and select iTunes and you're all set. The controls and track info should be working.


MAKING IT WORK WITH YouTube, SoundCloud, BandCamp, Spotify Web Player, VK, etc:

    1. Install the WebNowPlaying plugin extension for your browser
    2. Link for Firefox: addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firef…
    3. Link for Chrome and Chromium based browsers: chrome.google.com/webstore/det…
    4. Right-Click the skin, click on "Choose Player", and select WebNowPlaying.
    5. Done! If you face any problem at first with the extension,  restart your PC. That worked for me.

MAKING IT WORK WITH JRiver Media Center:
   Same as with AIMP, authorize your Last.Fm account on the JRiver App and select it in the skin.

MAKING IT WORK WITH Windows Media Player:
  Same as with iTunes but make sure the plugin for "Windows Media Player" is ticked/selected in settings of the Last.fm Desktop Scrobbler App.
